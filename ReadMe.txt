Whole project is available on: https://github.com/faci2000/EvolutionGenerator


1.  All required functions are implemented.

2.  To observe particular animal, you need to stop simulation and then by clicking on animal on map area,
    invoke messagebox which displays information about selected animal, where you can request simulation
    to display statistics in the bottom of statistics area.

3.  If you want to specify the number of days to observe animal, type in positive number of days in text
    field marked as 'Days lef to observe', otherwise type in negative number, to watch particular animals
    statistics till its death.

4.  If you want to save overall statistics from particular map, hit 'Save overall statistics' button anytime.
    The .txt will will be saved in main project directory, using name as follow: 'statisticsDataMap_.txt',
    where underline will be replaced by map ID.

5.  To specify starting parameters of simulations, write them down in file 'parameters.json' and save, before
    starting up new simulation.

6.  To highlight animals with dominating gene, stop simulation and hit 'Highlight animals with dominating gene'
